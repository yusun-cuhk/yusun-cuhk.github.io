I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Systems Engineering & Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), advised by Prof. [Daniel Zhuoyu Long](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~zylong/). 
Before my Ph.D., I received my bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2020.

My research interests lie in modeling and robust optimization in the diverse context of healthcare, discrete choice models, and revenue management. You can find my CV here:  [Yu Sun's CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
